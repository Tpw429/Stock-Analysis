# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Given a data set with a wide variety of different stocks and prices it was my job to create a user friendly VBA application that Steve could use to help him understand trends in the market. In addition, I looked to output answers as efficiently and swift as possible by refactoring code. With this challenge, I had to enable macros through Excel to access the power of VBA.
